              <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
              <p>
                Working in the IT industry has been my career path for a while.
                I wish to become a software developer and learn different
                languages along the way, as I love exploring new things every
                time. I think I would be satisfied with this career path, as I
                possess strong tenacity.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>
                2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes
                to learning
              </h2>
              <p>
                My strength and limitation are actually closely related. My
                strength is that when I deeply get into a certain task or topic,
                I tend to focus really well and with high efficiency.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                On the other hand, I may lose focus sometimes, especially when
                it's something that I'm struggling with. However, I can quickly
                acknowledge my focus level to take a rest if necessary.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Another strength that I believe I have is strong adaptability.
                After learning and understanding a concept, I like to think
                about how I could apply the knowledge in practical use.
              </p>

                see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I would like to develop my bravery in human skills. Asking
                questions or sharing thoughts with others has been somewhat of a
                weakness for me. I'm used to working in an independent
                environment, so I would like to overcome the fear of sharing my
                thoughts with others.
              </p>

                programme.
              </h2>
              <p>
                I will try to work with my cohort mates, sharing my progress on
                my workload and maybe getting used to asking silly questions in
                order to overcome my fear.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If I find myself still struggling, I will contact one of the
                facilitators, hoping to solve the issue.

              </h2>
              <p>
                I think, in order for that to happen smoothly, getting
                comfortable with my cohort mates and facilitators is crucial. Of
                course, before sharing my issue, I would do thorough research
                online for the sake of learning.

              </h2>
              <p>
                In the future, if I run into a nasty error that I’m stuck on for
                a long time, I hope the facilitator could briefly look at my
                code and point out the specific area I need to focus on to fix
                the error. That would be extremely helpful in relieving stress.
              </p>

                are committed to other things. For example, you might have
                whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan
                these in.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Usually, I have set days and times to go bouldering for my
                outdoor activities. Other than that, I can’t think of any other
                fixed activities throughout my week.
