              <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
              <p>
                Working in the IT industry has been my career path for a while.
                I wish to become a software developer and learn different
                languages along the way, as I love exploring new things every
                time. I think I would be satisfied with this career path, as I
                possess strong tenacity.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>
                2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes
                to learning
              </h2>
              <p>
                My strength and limitation are actually closely related. My
                strength is that when I deeply get into a certain task or topic,
                I tend to focus really well and with high efficiency.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                On the other hand, I may lose focus sometimes, especially when
                it's something that I'm struggling with. However, I can quickly
                acknowledge my focus level to take a rest if necessary.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Another strength that I believe I have is strong adaptability.
                After learning and understanding a concept, I like to think
                about how I could apply the knowledge in practical use.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                I would like to develop my bravery in human skills. Asking
                questions or sharing thoughts with others has been somewhat of a
                weakness for me. I'm used to working in an independent
                environment, so I would like to overcome the fear of sharing my
                thoughts with others.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                I will try to work with my cohort mates, sharing my progress on
                my workload and maybe getting used to asking silly questions in
                order to overcome my fear.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If I find myself still struggling, I will contact one of the
                facilitators, hoping to solve the issue.

              <p>
                I think, in order for that to happen smoothly, getting
                comfortable with my cohort mates and facilitators is crucial. Of
                course, before sharing my issue, I would do thorough research
                online for the sake of learning.

                In the future, if I run into a nasty error that I’m stuck on for
                a long time, I hope the facilitator could briefly look at my
                code and point out the specific area I need to focus on to fix
                the error. That would be extremely helpful in relieving stress.

              <h2>1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
              <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, I aspire to become a software developer.
                I want to strengthen my technical skills while also building my
                human skills so I can excel in collaboration and communication.
              </p>

                2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will
                be in Bootcamp?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Throughout my foundation, I believe my strengths have remained
                consistent and have been extremely beneficial. I’ve also
                realized that my curiosity about certain concepts can be a real
                asset during the Bootcamp.
              </p>

                3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
                Bootcamp will be?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Since we’ve been working entirely online during the foundation,
                I’m curious to see how I’ll adapt in an offline enviornment. I
                hope to stay engaged in my learning and overcome any hesitation,
                becoming more active and confident in face-to-face interactions.

              <p>
                I’d like to continue developing my ability to share my ideas
                more confidently and speak more comfortably in front of others.

              <h2>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
              <p>
                My expectation of the learning environment in Bootcamp is that
                it will be more focused on self-directed learning, with
                facilitators available throughout the day to support us. I’m
                also really looking forward to experiencing pair programming and
                collaborating with others.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
              <p>
                I will of course arrive at 8:30am at our site. Get ready with my
                mental attitude in some way that suits me. If I find myself
                stuck on something for too long, I’ll have a mental limit in
                place,and once I reach it, I’ll make sure to ask for help rather
                than stay stuck.
              </p>
              <p>
                During pair programming, I’ll be open and receptive to my
                partner’s ideas and approaches. I believe that everyone has a
                unique way of solving problems, and I’m genuinely interested in
                learning from different perspectives and exploring alternative
                solutions.
