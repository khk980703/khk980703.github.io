              <p>
                One time, I found a lost dog wandering around the main street
                near my house and decided to bring it back to its owner. I
                wasn't completely sure if I remembered the dog's owner
                correctly, but I decided to give it a try anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
                Luckily, I was right, and the dog was able to make its way home.
                The owner was so happy and thanked me over and over, which made
                me feel really proud and joyful.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I consider myself to be someone who’s a little hesitant and not
                very adventurous, so stepping into something unfamiliar was a
                bit challenging for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, situations like this help me grow and overcome my
                weaknesses. It built my confidence and made me less hesitant
                when making decisions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Even though I wasn’t entirely sure of the outcome, taking action
                and seeing a successful result gave me a huge dopamine and a
                sense of reward that’s hard to describe.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a special experience that I’ll always remember. Now,
                knowing the satisfaction, I’m more open to trying new things
                leading to more self-development.
              </p>

                2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have
                influenced your values and identity.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Usually, I have a good understanding of my weaknesses through
                self-reflection, however recognizing my own strengths was
                something I lacked. In this regard, the people around me help me
                see myself from different perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                With their support, I’ve discovered many of my strengths, which
                has given me more confidence in the path I’m on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                These may have been acknowledged through out the comparison from
                others, but I believe it's usually from the good words absorbed
                from my peole ensuring my confidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although, I do come across realisation of my weaknesses, I value
                them even more as they give me the opportunity for
                self-improvement. I love working on these areas to grow and
                become a better person.

              </h2>
              <p>
                I believe I possess lots of strengths. I'm a problem solver,
                hardworking, and persistent when it comes to completing tasks.
                Among all my strengths, I consider my positive mindset to be the
                most essencial skill I own.
              </p>
              <p>
                It helps me overcome any obstacles I encounter during my
                learning journey and enables me to successfully complete my
                tasks.

                4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and
                career development. How might these affect your learning
                journey?
              </h2>
              <p>
                My limitation might be that I tend to complete tasks a bit
                slower than others. I like to deeply understand what I’m
                learning, and when I work, I can be somewhat of a perfectionist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recognizing this limitation, I try to view myself from a third
                person's perspective and assess whether I’m striking the right
                balance in what I’m doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I aim to find the sweet spot between rushing and overworking,
                ensuring I maintain the best efficiency in completing tasks. By
                managing this limitation, I believe it can sometimes convert
                into a strength.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Secondly, I sometimes may have some trouble asking others for
                help as I consider myself a fairly independant person. However,
                I’ve come to realize that trying to handle everything on my own
                for a long time isn’t the most efficient way to make progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, I seek for help more often and make an effort to
                share my thoughts as much as possible. Now, I’ve started to
                enjoy overcoming this limitation and becoming more
                communicative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, I am really looking forward to the collaborative work
                environment in our bootcamp learning.
              </p>
              <br /><br />

                5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively
                with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
                strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
                your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and
                why.
              </h2>
              <p>
                I don’t often encounter situations like that, but I did
                experience a minor conflict once while working with others. In
                that case, there was already some miscommunication between us.
              </p>
              <p>
                To resolve it, I first made an effort to listen to the
                opposition's opinion and really try to understand their
                perspective and their argument. If I could coordinate a middle
                ground, I would propose a compromise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Otherwise, I would persuade the reasons behind our disagreement
                with the clarification of my own perspective, and try to find an
                alternative solution that would benefit both of us.
