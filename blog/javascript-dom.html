                  What is JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
                </h2>
                <p>
                  JavaScript could be referenced as the brain of a webpage. In a
                  simple term, it assists with page movement, response, and all
                  other actions that need to be taken.
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul style="margin-left: 3%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    HTML shows what's on the page.
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    CSS makes it pretty.
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    JavaScript makes it dynamic.

                <br /><br />
                <h2>What is Control Flow?</h2>
                <p>
                  Control Flow is the order of the structure of statements that
                  needs to be followed. It's like a routine of whatever you are
                  doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you have a routine after waking up, everything
                  would be fine if followed. However, if you are off a little
                  from your routine, usually something goes wrong.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>What is Loops?</h2>
                <p>
                  Loops are a sequence of instructions that is continually
                  repeated until a specific condition is reached.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you were to run 2 kilometers on a running
                  track that is 400m long in an oval shape, a sequence of
                  instructions could be referred to the action of running and a
                  certain condition would be how long you need to run, in this
                  case 2 kilometers.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>What is DOM?</h2>
                <p>
                  DOM is an abbreviation of Document Object Model. It's there to
                  help interact with all the HTML elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  DOM is a copy of things inside the HTML document represented
                  in an object type.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This way, it is easier to access the HTML elements when
                  dealing with JaveScript. Browsers provide a 'document'
                  JavaScript object with a large number of properties to
                  interact in all sorts of ways.
                </p>
                <p>You can briefly visualize the document as a tree diagram:</p>
                <br />
                <div class="blog-section-image">
                  <div class="blog-section-example-layout">
                    <img
                      style="width: 450px"
                      src="../img/dom-tree.png"
                      alt="example pic..."
                    />
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>How to access HTML elements using the DOM.</h2>
                <p>
                  You can access HTML elements through the object 'document'.
                  Just like how you normally access an object type, you would
                  follow the structure 'document.___' way.
                </p>
                <p>The three most common things to query by are:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    by tag name (element name, such as 'p' or 'div')
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    by class name (class attribute e.g. class="container")
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    by id (id attribute e.g. id="logo")
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The three different methods are used in different situations.
                  But, ideally, to access individual elements in the HTML
                  document, id is the most common way to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, if you want to access multiple elements at
                  once, you would access them with a tag or class name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The way you can access these is through
                  'document.querySelector("__")', and you receive the
                  information related to the query you selected in the object
                  type.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>How to use HTML elements using the DOM.</h2>
                <p>
                  You can manipulate the elements in the same way you use an
                  object type variable. We can use '.innerHTML' attribute to
                  both get and set the inner HTML tags.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    'let value = document.querySelector('__').innerHTML' will
                    set the variable 'value' to the inner HTML value of
                    whichever query is selected.
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    'document.querySelector('__').innerHTML = "I have changed
                    the value!"' will change the inner HTML value of whichever
                    query that is selected to 'I have changed the value!'.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We need to note that selecting a class or the tag, will only
                  access the first element of the HTML document. In order to
                  select all the queries, you would use '.querySelectorAll'
                  instead.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>More examples of things you can do with DOM.</h2>
                <p>
                  There are a few more commonly used attributes through the
                  'querySelector' object like '.setAttribute' and
                  '.addEventListener'.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 style="font-size: 16px">.setAttribute()</h2>
                <p>
                  This helps us modify a few things like the style of the
                  element, src, or href.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    'exampleSpan.setAttribute('style', 'color: red; font-weight:
                    bold')' modifies the 'exampleSpan' with the style specified
                    in the 'setAttribute' bracket.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <h2 style="font-size: 16px">.addEventListener()</h2>
                <p>
                  There are many ways to use the 'addEventListener'. This is the
                  main way to interact with the click, keystrokes, mouse moves,
                  and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 'addEventListener' has the attribute 'event' to
                  specifically achieve what you want to do.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    document.querySelector('#test-button').addEventListener('click',
                    (event) => { console.log(event.target) }) will follow the id
                    query '#test-button' which can receive a button click, and
                    once the action happens, it will have the accessibility to
                    the inner HTML value of the button.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />
                <h2>What is an Array and objects?</h2>
                <p>
                  Array is like a tube container that you can store items into.
                  Object is almost like an array but it can store additional
                  details for each item.
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    Array - It is used with square brackets '[]' and there are
                    many methods you could interact with arrays like '.length',
                    '.sort()', '.forEach()', and many more.
                  </li>
                  <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                    Objects - It is used with curly brackets '{}' and it
                    contains keys and values. For example, 'obj = {key1 :
                    value1, key2 : value2}' and to access, 'obj.key1' or
                    'obj[key1]' would give us 'val1'.
                  </li>

                <h2>What are functions?</h2>
                <p>
                  Functions are like recipes of foods. It is like a page of
                  instructions which can be reused. It is helpful when your
                  codes are repetitively used, you could simply premake a
                  function and just use the function name to execute the
                  instructions.
