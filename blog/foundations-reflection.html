                1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and
                your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Through the Human SKills learning, I've discovered that I have a
                strong sense of initiative, which could potentially help me in
                the future where leadership or action is needed. I also became
                more aware of my emotional intelligence, realizing how it plays
                a key role in how I understand and connect with others. Lastly,
                I've learnt that anyone including myself are capable of adapting
                and growing, especially when we embrace a growth mindset.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>
                2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
                learning and programming?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Values, empathy, and self-awareness play a crucial role in
                learning and programming by shaping how we interact, solve
                problems, and grow. Being grounded in values helps guide our
                decisions and integrity in our work. Empathy allows us to
                collaborate effectively and create user-centered solutions,
                while self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and areas
                for improvement, empowering us to share ideas confidently and
                reach our full potential.

                3. What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills
                learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Understanding how neuroplasticity works gives me a powerful
                sense of control over my own growth. Knowing that I can improve
                in areas I’ve struggled with shows me what’s possible through
                effort and persistence.
              </p>

                4. What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
                learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I’ve always found it challenging to introduce myself to
                strangers. It’s something that used to make me feel
                uncomfortable or hesitant. However, throughout the Human Skills
                journey, I’ve noticed a real shift in myself. I’ve become more
                confident and open, and that initial discomfort is starting to
                fade as I grow more comfortable engaging with new people.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>
                5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so
                much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
                Bootcamp course?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Because success in web development isn't just about writing good
                code, it's also about being able to work effectively with
                others. Collaboration, communication, and emotional intelligence
                are essential in real-world team environments. By strengthening
                these skills, we’re better prepared to contribute meaningfully,
                solve problems together, and thrive in professional settings.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>
                6. Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here
                feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time
                to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Not at all! I don’t see the time spent on Human Skills as a
                waste. In fact, I believe it’s a valuable part of the learning
                experience. Developing these skills has helped me grow not just
                as a programmer, but as a person. The ability to communicate
                well, understand others, and reflect on myself will benefit me
                in any team setting, job interview, or life situation. It
                complements technical skills and prepares me for real-world
                challenges beyond just writing code.
