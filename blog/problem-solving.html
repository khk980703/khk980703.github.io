              <h2>Time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
              <p>
                When I was trying to utilize the JavaScript builtin function
                'map()', I struggled with an error corresponding to that.
                Eventually, I found out that for some reason I thought the
                function changes the original array, but actually, it returns a
                new array with the changed variables. All I needed to do was to
                assign a new variable name to it to solve the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout most of my errors, I've tried the rubber ducky
                method, reading error messages, and console.logging the most.
                Usually, with just those three methods, I was able to get
                through most of the simple problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout these trials and errors, I've realized that most of
                the time there are just a few pieces of the puzzle missing.
                Having a thorough look into what I've written and drawing it out
                in my head gives me a clear outcome of my code.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>Time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
              <p>
                From one of the stretch exercises, I struggled to understand the
                requirements of the question. It was asked to assign a value as
                a function with the key 'win'. At first, I did not realize we
                could assign a function itself as a value in an object.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to look into the code with the problem-solving methods
                that I listed above and they helped a lot. Looking into the code
                from the start testing out each step that I took revealed where
                I've gone wrong and was able to fix the problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                There was a time that I was reluctant to ask on Discord. While I
                was struggling with using 'map()' function, I thought I had a
                good understanding of what the function does and how to use it.
                After struggling for a while, I decided to ask on Discord for
                help, but before taking action, I had one last look into my code
                to see if I was missing out on a simple problem. Funny to say, I
                managed to find the error on my own and ended up not asking
                about the question.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the things that make me reluctant to ask for help are
                because I keep thinking that it's a simple problem and it's
                something that I can fix. Usually, that may end up me falling
                into a long loop of repeated stress, so I try my best to not
                fall into one.
