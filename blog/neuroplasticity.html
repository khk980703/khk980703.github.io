              <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt by
                forming new neural connections throughout life.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means our brains can modify in response to new information,
                experiences, or even injuries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than being fixed, the brain is a dynamic and evolving
                system.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Understanding how neuroplasticity works gives me a powerful
                sense of control over my own growth. Knowing that I can improve
                in areas I’ve struggled with shows me what’s possible through
                effort and persistence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, this could relate to the words 'humans are adaptable
                creatures'. While neuroplasticity can help us develop better
                thinking patterns, it also means negative habits can become
                ingrained if we’re not careful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, I believe stabilizing good habbits is crucial, so we
                are always moving forward rather than regressing. Of course,
                replacing bad habbits is just as essential as developing new
                skills.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                To improve our neuroplasticity, we could modify 4 variables for
                the improvement of our knowledge:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                  Attention - Staying focused and engaged while learning.
                </li>
                <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                  Generation - Reflecting on the skills that we already have.
                </li>
                <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                  Emotion - Associating learning with positive emotions and
                  motivation.
                </li>
                <li style="color: #666; font-size: 14px">
                  Spacing - Using repetition and giving our brain time to
                  consolidate information into long-term memory.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence
                can be developed through effort, learning, and perseverance.
                This contrasts with a fixed mindset, which assumes your traits
                are static and unchangeable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is closely related as it provides the biological
                foundation for the growth mindset. When you embrace challenges,
                make mistakes, and persist through effort, your brain forms new
                neural connections showing neuroplasticity in action.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The fact that our brain is flexible and not static is something
                that I often forget. This journey helped solidify the idea of a
                growth mindset in my mind and made it feel more real and
                achievable.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Moving forward, I’ll actively seek out challenges as
                opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge. I want to embrace
                learning, even when it’s difficult because that’s where real
                progress happens.
              </p>
